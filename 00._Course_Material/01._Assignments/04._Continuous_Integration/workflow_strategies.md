# Research and pick a workflow strategy

**Type**: Do this assignment individually (the research part) and then make a group decision on how you want to collaborate. 

For the exam your group will be expected to have picked a workflow and branching strategies.

During the exam you will be expected to be able to explain your choices and reflect on pros and cons about the specific choice in comparison with others.
