# Create a Github Project

**Type**: Group

In your group repository create a Github project for the repositor(y/ies) that you use for your courses this semester.

It's up to which view you prefer:

It's perfectly fine if you prefer Trello or similiar Kanban solutions but try to create a board in Github for the sake of this assignment at least.
