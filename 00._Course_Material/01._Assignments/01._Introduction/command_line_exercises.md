## Solve the command_line_exercises. 

They can be found here:

[Command Line Exercises](./command_line_exercises/)

There are 6 files. Coordinate within your group so that each group member solves a unique set of commands. 

## What you must hand-in

The exercises have been randomly generated by a script. 

Mark the tasks that cannot be performed and hand a list of the numbers and the text "Cannot be completed".
For extra points, explain why they cannot be done.  

Be careful not to delete actual things on your system. Don't just follow the commands blindly but pay attention to what you are actually doing.

## Suggestion

This exercise has a 2 week deadline and I recommend you to solve it slowly. 

Rather than doing them all at once, do about 20 - 25 commands daily until navigating, creating etc. becomes a habit.
