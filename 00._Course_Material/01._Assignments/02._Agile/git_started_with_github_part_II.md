## Git Started II - Play around in groups

Do this with your designated semester groups.

1. Create a repository. 

2. Add each other as collaborators. 

3. Clone the repository and push a change on the main branch. 
Do not fork the repository. Forking it creates a new repository. 
Now that you are collaborators you can work on the same repository.
