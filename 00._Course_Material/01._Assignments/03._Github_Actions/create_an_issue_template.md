## [Individual/Group] Create an issue template

Create an issues template. In root of the repository create a .github folder. 

Inside of it create a file called ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md

By naming it exactly that in exactly that place, Github will pick it up as your issues template. 

Define a template for issues and try to create a new issue. 
This will provide a template for people looking to create issues (bugs, feature requests etc.).

It's up to you if you want to do try it individually, do it in the joint repository (group) or both.
