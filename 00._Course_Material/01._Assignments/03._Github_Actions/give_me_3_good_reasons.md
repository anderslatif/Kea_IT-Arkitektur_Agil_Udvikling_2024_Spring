## [Individual] Give me 3 good reasons.

Submit a text to Teams stating 3 reasons why you find this course to be relevant as an "IT-arkitektur" student.

The goal here is not to search for answers online but to reflect. 

You have a week after the guest lecture to do it. The best timeline would be to:

- Reflect on the question before the guest lecture and create a draft with bulletpoints, keywords etc.. 
- Further reflect on it after the guest lecture.
- Only then, write the final text.
