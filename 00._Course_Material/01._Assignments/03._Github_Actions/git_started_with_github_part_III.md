## Git Started III - Play around in groups

Work on the repository from Git Started II. 

1. Create a new branch. Can be done either in the Github UI or locally. 
I recommend the latter but it requires you to push the local branch to remote.

```bash
$ git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

2. Push a change on that branch. 

3. Create a pull request in the Github UI that someone else in the group accepts.
