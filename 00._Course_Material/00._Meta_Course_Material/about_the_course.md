## Resources

This is the central repository for the course. It contains assignments and slides. 

Feel free to make a Pull Request to suggest changes and improvements to any of the course material. No change is too small!
The student with the most accepted PRs will receive a prize by the end of the semester. 

We will be writing code in this repository among others. 

As we proceed during the semester links to other repositories will be pinned in Teams.  

The repositories will be made private and uploaded as zip files to Teams after the first set of exams. 

Teams will be used for communication. @ me so I can see if you have typed a question there. 

Besides deeply personal matters all communication should be in the Teams channel. This create transparency and gives everyone the ability to see the discussion and my answers. 

Hand-ins will be in Teams as well. 

## Meta about the lectures

Be on time. 

It will be hands-on so shout out immediately if the pace is too fast. 

Immediately state if you are running into technical problems. 

Participate, participate, participate!

# Debugging during lectures

This course is mixes slides and live coding. If you run into problems during the live coding sections then ask me for a more time or help. 

If I evaluate that the lecture must proceed then please drop it and debug later. 

I don't want you to lose out on important new information.

## Topics vs. Learning Goals + Exam

Learning goals are formulated in a way that they should reveal what you are expected to learn after each week. 
The wording is intentionally precise and reveal whether you are expected to know about, fully understand, be able to code, remember without help etc. 

Agil Udvikling will be part of the overall exam for this semester. I will not be present during the exam and you should see this course as an aid for you to create infrastructure that the eases development of your semester project.
