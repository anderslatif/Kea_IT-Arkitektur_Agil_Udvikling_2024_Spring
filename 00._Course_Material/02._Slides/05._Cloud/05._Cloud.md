# Cloud Service Model - Part I

- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**
    - Delivers applications over the internet.
    - Users access software from web browsers.
    - Examples: Google Workspace, Salesforce.

- **FaaS (Function as a Service)**
    - Enables running code in response to events.
    - Serverless execution; no need to manage servers.
    - Examples: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions.


---

# Cloud Service Model - Part II

- **DaaS (Desktop as a Service)**
    - Provides virtual desktop environments.
    - Hosted and managed by a third party.
    - Examples: Amazon WorkSpaces, VMware Horizon Cloud.

- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**
    - Offers hardware and software tools over the internet.
    - Typically used for applications development.
    - Examples: Google App Engine, Heroku.

---
    
# Cloud Service Model - Part III

- **STaaS (Storage as a Service)**
    - Provides data storage as a service.
    - Accessible through a network (commonly the internet).
    - Examples: Google Cloud Storage, Dropbox.

- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**
    - Offers fundamental computing resources.
    - Includes virtual machines, storage, and networks.
    - Examples: Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure.

# Cost management - Resource Groups I


Please beware that even if no services are running, if a resource group exists it can still use a lot of money. Delete resource groups when not in use. 

Exception: Network Watcher:

# Cost management - II

Recommendation: When possible use free services.

    <h1>Virtual Machines</h1>
</div>

# Virtual machines 

Virtual machine is the generic term for servers in the cloud.

In AWS they are called **EC2**. In Azure, **Azure Virtual Machines**.

Let's manually create a virtual machine (through Azure Free Services). 

But first, let's generate an SSH key locally which we will use to login.

---

# Generating a SSH-key

Generate a 4096-bit RSA SSH-key pair. 

*nix (tldr ssh-keygen):

```bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "comment|email‚Äù
```

Windows (2048-bit RSA key is the default): 

```powershell
$ ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -b 4096
```

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/create-ssh-keys-detailed

---

# Let's create a virtual machine

Various OS to choose from. We will use the latest version of Ubuntu.

Allow port 22 so we can ssh into it. 

<div>
    <img src="./assets/allow_port_22.png" alt="Port 22 ssh inbound rule allow"/>
</div>

---

# SSH into the virtual machine

In case of permission issues:

```bash
$ chmod 600 /path/to/your/file.pem
```

---

# The `apt` package manager

Since we setup an Ubuntu server we can use the default package manager for Debian. 

Ubuntu is a flavor within the broader Debian ecosystem.

If a package exists in the default repository we can run:

```bash
$ sudo apt install <package_name>
```

---

#  Let's install Node.js via `nvm` - I

Node.js is only included in personal package archives (PPA) and not the public one so we need to install it in a roundabout way.

There are several ways to install Node.js. One is through Node Version Manager (nvm).

Download and install:

```bash
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
```

Running `source` on the terminal settings file will reload the terminal with the new configurations:

```bash
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

---
#  Let's install Node.js via `nvm` - II

Test that we have installed `nvm`:

```bash
$ nvm --version
```

Install the latest version:

```bash
$ nvm install node
```

nvm makes installing specific versions of node nad switching between them quick.

This is useful if a project requries a specific version of Node.js.

---

# Debugging step: Upgrade the Ubuntu server

If you get the following error the default Azure ubuntu version is outdated:

```
node: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.28' not found (required by node)
```

Solution: Upgrade the server:

```bash
$ sudo do-release-upgrade
```

Alternative way:

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt full-upgrade
```

---

# Confirm the installation:

Success if both commands output a version number:

```bash
$ node -v
$ npm -v
```

---

# Network management: Ports I

There are two type of rules:

1. Inbound: Traffic going **TO** the VM.

2. Outbund: Traffic going **OUT** the VM. 

Define an inbound rule to whitelist the port that the application is running on so we can access it from the internet.

# Create a static IP address

---

# Let's tear it down!

Delete it and **REMEMBER** to also delete the resource group!

Repetition: In Azure, a resource group will still cost money, even if there is no service associated with. 

---

# VPC / VNET

VPC: Virtual Private Cloud (often associated with AWS)
VNET: Virtual Network (Azure's term)
I will use the generic term VPC in class.

A VPC is an isolated cloud network within a public cloud environment.
Allows cloud services in the same data center to communicate securely without going through the public internet. 
Provides control over IP address ranges, subnets, network gateways, and security settings.

---

# VPC security (NACL)

NACL (Network Access Control Layer):

- NACL

- SG (Security Groups)

- Firewall

---

# Subnets

Private subnets

Public subnets

---

# Gateways

IG (internet gateway)

VPC Peering (connect multiple VPCs)

NAT (allows devices in the VPC to connect to the internet)

---

# Application Layer

NLB (Network Load Balancer)

ALB (Application Load Balancer)

# Cloud storage

AWS: S3 (Simple Storage Service)

Azure: Azure Blob Storage

<img src="./assets/azure_blob_storage_logo.png" alt="AWS S3" width="200" height="100">

---

# Azure Blob Storage - I

Use the one under Free Services. 

<img src="./assets/azure_blob_storage_free_service.png" alt="Azure blob storage free service" width="200" height="100">

A Blob Storage can contain multiple contains. Try to upload a file but create a container first. 

Anonymous access level (No other access level is allowed on Azure For Students):

* Private (no anonymous access)

---

# Azure Blob Storage - II

Access not permitted when trying to open the file:

<img src="./assets/azure_blob_storage_access_not_permitted.png" alt="Azure blob storage access not permitted" width="200" height="100">

Here are the thing that can be done: 

1. Enable Anonymous Public Read Access 

2. Using Azure AD (Active Directory)

3. Generate a Shared Access Signature (SAS) URL

---

# Shared Access Signature (SAS)

There is a subfolder in this folder titled `generating_sas_token_azureblobstorage` in it you will find a code example in Node.js for how to generate a SAS token. 

Read the README.md to see how. The instructions assume that `az` has been installed.

# Serverless computing

<img src="./assets/aws_lambda_vs._azure_functions.png" alt="AWS Lambda vs. Azure Functions" style="height: 30vh">


---

# Why serverless?

Saves time. Easier to deploy.

Scalable. 

Saves money. (Azure Functions Different pricing plans.)


---

# Azure Functions - subscription models

* **Consumption plan**: Pay for the time that your code runs.

* **Premium plan**: You specify a number of pre-warmed instances that are always online. 

* **App service plan**: Run as if they are web apps. Not serverless.

---

# Azure Functions - Ways to deploy

* In the browser.

* Terminal. 

* Visual Studio (extension).

* VSCode.

---

# Tools for local development

Tools: 

- CLI
- Visual Studio
- VS Code (extension)
- Storage emulators (local)

---

# Cold starts - A problem

Cold start: The time it takes to allocate the function to a server and setup the runtime environment before your code can run.

Functions are held warm for roughly 20 minutes according to below source.

# Let's create an Azure function in the portal

Must create a Function App. A Function App can contain multiple functions. 
Must associate storage with a Function App.

To call with name key defined in the query string:
Set the authentication level to anonymous either in integration or function.json.
Use the Function key [default] URL. 

---

# Azure Key Vault

A way to store values outside of the code such as environment variables. 

Can be used to authenticate services. 
Also useful for authorization. Access policies can limit usage.

Example use case:
Define the database connection string here. Functions can then get the connection string from the Key Vault. Now it‚Äôs removed from the code and can be changed in one place.

# Ways to work with cloud services

From okay to best:
