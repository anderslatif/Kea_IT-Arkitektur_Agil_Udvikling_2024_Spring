# Let's create a semester repository together!

Get the repository locally:

```bash
$ git clone <repository_url>
```

---

<div class="title-card">
    <h1>Let's learn how to push!</h1>
</div>

---

# Pushing, Step 1: Adding Files

Add all files:

```bash
$ git add -A
```
Add everything here and nested foloders:

```bash
$ git add . 
```

```bash
$ git add <filename\folder>
```

---

# Pushing, Step 2: Commiting Files

Commit with a message:

```bash
$ git commit -m "<message>"
```

---

# Pushing, Step 3:  Pushing to remote

Push the code to remote:

```bash
$ git push
```

---

# Try it out! - Let's update the README.md.

---

# Pulling

If others are working on the same repository, get the latest changes:

```bash
$ git pull
```

# Historical View 

Before DevOps: release cycle: months - years

Ideal: Multiple times a day

Goal: How do we create infrastructure to reach the ideal without firefighting

Why? To bring value to the users

# CI/CD/CD

* Continuous Integration

Pushing code to a Version Control System (VCS such as git etc.).

* Continuous Delivery

Packaging your code (We will create Docker images).

* Continuous Deployment

Deploy to a server.

Most people just call it CI/CD.

# CI/CD
Goal: automation. 
Term: Pipelines

# Directories and moving

Output current directory (`pwd`):

```bash
$ pwd
```

Change into a directory (`cd`):

```bash
$ cd <directory>
```

Move one directory up (note: `..` is a special directory name that is the parent of the current directory):

```bash
$ cd ..
```

---

<div class="exercise-card" style="color: green;">
    <h1>Exercise</h1>
</div>

How do you move back into the directory?

---

# Listing files and directories

List directory contents (`ls`):

```bash
$ ls
```

List directory contents with details (`ls -l`):

```bash
$ ls -l
```

List directory contents with details and hidden files (`ls -la`):

```bash
$ ls -la
```

---

# Listing files in a directory

List files in a directory (`ls <directory>`):

```bash
$ ls <directory>
```

List files in this directory (note: `.` is a special directory name that refers to the current directory):

```bash
$ ls .
```

---

<div class="exercise-card" style="color: green;">
    <h1>Exercise</h1>
</div>

How do you list the files in the parent directory?

---

# Creating and deleting directories

Create a new directory (`mkdir`):

```bash
$ mkdir <directory_name>
```

Delete a directory (`rmdir`):

```bash
$ rmdir <directory_name>
```

Delete a directory (`rm -rf`):

```bash
$ rm -rf <directory>
```

---

<div class="exercise-card" style="color: green;">
    <h1>Exercise</h1>
</div>

Create a directory called `test`, move into it and create a directory called `test2`.
Now move back into the parent directory and delete `test2` and `test`.

---

# File handling:

Copy a file (`cp`):

```bash
$ cp <source> <destination>
```

Move or rename a file (`mv`):

```bash
$ mv <source> <destination>
```

Delete a file (`rm`):

```bash
$ rm <filename>
```


---


# Terminal commands - files (*nix):

Output hello:

```bash
$ echo hello
```

Create an empty file (`touch`):

```bash
$ touch <filename>
```

Display file contents (`cat`):

```bash
$ cat <filename>
```

---

# Terminal commands - files (Windows):

Create a new file (PowerShell):

```powershell
New-Item <filename> -ItemType "file"
```

Display file contents (PowerShell):

```powershell
Get-Content <filename>
```

    <h1>General info regarding files</h1>
</div>

---

# Tips regarding files

Avoid spaces in files and folders!

**Use Descriptive Names**: Choose file names that clearly indicate the content or purpose of the file.

**Avoid Special Characters**: Besides spaces, avoid using special characters like `/`, `\`, `:`, `*`, `?`, `"`, `<`, `>`, `|`, etc.

**Cross-Platform Compatibility**: If files will be used across different operating systems, consider compatibility (e.g., case sensitivity in file names in \*NIX vs. Windows).

---

# Hidden files and folders

**In *nix**, a file or folder is made hidden by prefixing its name with a dot `.`. For example, `.example`.

**In Windows**, the 'hidden' attribute is set on the file or folder, which can be done through file properties or using the command `attrib +h`.

Finder / Explorer can be configured to either show or hide hidden folders / files. 

---


# Folders and files that should never be pushed

JetBrains creates the `.idea` folder which is IDE preference specific. 

VSCode creates `.vscode` which contains user specific preferences and shouldn't be forced onto others. 

MacOS creates `.DS_Store` folders that relate to Finder settings. 

Windows creates `Thumbs.db`.

---

# Add to the global .gitignore: \*nix

Check if file exists:

```bash
$ git config --global core.excludesfile
```

Modify the file:

```bash
$ nano ~/.gitignore
```

Configure the file (tell Git to use it, remember to point correctly to the file):

```bash
$ git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore
```

---
# Add to the global .gitignore: Windows

Check if file exists:

```powershell
$ git config --global core.excludesfile
```

Modify the file:

```powershell
$ notepad C:\Users\YourUsername\.gitignore_global
```

Configure the file (tell Git to use it):

```powershell
$ git config --global core.excludesfile C:\Users\YourUsername\.gitignore_global
```

# Git advice - write proper commit messages - I

* **Clarity**: Explains changes for team members and future reference.
* **Tracking**: Aids in understanding project evolution and change history.
* **Review Efficiency**: Simplifies code reviews by clearly explaining changes.
* **Debugging Aid**: Helps pinpoint when and why changes were made for troubleshooting.
* **Documentation**: Acts as a record for future reference, helpful for new team members.
* **Professionalism**: Reflects disciplined, best practice approach in software development.

---

# Git advice - write proper commit messages - I

Personal suggestion:

`<past_tense_verb> + <action>`

Examples: 

- Refactored the integration test s

- Created a dark mode feature

- Implemented a POST /users route

Can you come up with commit messages that follow this structure?

---
# Quitting

Different programs have different ways to terminate them. These include:

```
q
```

```
:q
```

```
CTRL-C
```

```
CTRL-D
```

---

# Text Editors - Windows: 

No text editors for the terminal. 

```powershell
$ notepad <filename>
```

```powershell
$ code <filename>
```

---

# Text Editors in *nix Systems

#### **Nano**: Simple and User-Friendly.

#### **Vi/Vim**: Advanced and Powerful: Offers extensive functionality for complex editing tasks.

**Multiple Modes**:

- **Normal Mode**: Default mode for navigation and command execution.

- **Insert Mode**: Allows typing and editing text, similar to standard text editors.

- **Visual Mode**: Enables text selection using arrow keys; supports standard clipboard operations.

- **Visual Block Mode**: Facilitates block-shaped text selection and manipulation.
