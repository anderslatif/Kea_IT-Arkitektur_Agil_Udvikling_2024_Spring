# Historical View: NOT! agile

Software __engineers__ created software **blueprints**.

Before you could even start implementing (coding) you had to do:

- Feasability study, Market research
- Risk analysis
- Requirement analysis
- Write thorough specification
- System and software design
- Feature extraction and estimation

# Discuss: What are the problems with the waterfall model?

---

# Note: The waterfall model has its place

For some projects the waterfall model is the right choice. For instance, when there is only one iteration needed before the project is done. 

Also, analyzing and planning before coding is extremely important, especially for large systems. 

Agile development does not eliminate those steps.
Instead it allows one to move back and forth between the steps.

# Let's be critical!

Research into the state of agile in the industry: 

https://www.itpro.com/software/agile-development-is-fading-in-popularity-at-large-enterprises-and-developer-burnout-is-a-key-factor

Problems: 

- Culture clash: Organizational resistance
- Lack of leadership support
- Siloed teams 

> “The larger the organization, the more likely it is to use a hybrid model,” the report said, noting that bigger teams are also more likely to still use waterfall.

The research still finds value in agile. It finds it to be best in small organizations.

# Be critical of buzzwords in this industry

Many companies claim that they're agile when they're not.

# Why DevOps?

*DevOps is an easy sell because it is focused on creating value (for the business > for customers > for developers):*

Easy to make small changes and fix bugs ⇒ better product for user ⇒ business makes cash

Quicker way to deploy new features ⇒ competitive product on the market ⇒ business makes cash

Tests ensure robustness ⇒ production isn’t down ⇒ business makes cash

Server access isn’t given freely ⇒ better security means lesser chance of hacking ⇒ business makes cash

Infrastructure is reproducible ⇒ recovery takes minutes rather than days or weeks ⇒ business makes cash

```bash
$ git checkout main

# Git stash

Stashing is helpful when you want to pull (requires uncommited file changes) but don't want to create a commit just yet. 

Stash (temprorarily shelve) changes:

```bash
$ git stash
```

Reapply the most recent stash:

```bash
$ git stash pop
```

It's also possible to stash by a name and apply a specific stash.

---

# When nothing else works...

"Just give me what is in the repository right now".
Warning: this throws away all your uncommited changes:

```bash
$ git reset --hard origin
```

# Hello World workflow

Let's manually create a workflow that echoes "Hello World" on every push and PR.

1. Create a new repository. 

2. Create .github/workflows

3. In it, create a file called hello_world.yaml

---

# In hello_world.yaml 


```yaml
name: Hello world workflow

on:
    push:
        branches:
            - main
    pull_request:
        branches:
            - main
    workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
    hello: 
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - name: Hello world
              run: echo "Hello world"
              shell: bash
```
